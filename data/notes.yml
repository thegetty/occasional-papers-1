    note: "Some people claim that attacks on heritage are part of genocide. On this view, of course, to defend heritage is to prevent genocide. But this semantic move—broadening the definition of <em>genocide</em>—doesn’t show that one can use force to defend heritage. It simply makes it an open question whether one may use force to prevent genocide."

    note: "Proportionality is thought by some writers to subsume the requirement that force have a reasonable prospect of success.

For criticism, see Frowe, *Defensive Killing*, 148–53. The relationship between proportionality and necessity is complex (see, for example, Seth Lazar, “Necessity in Self-Defense and War,” *Philosophy and Public Affairs* 40, no. 1 [2012]: 3–44), but our characterization here is that standardly employed by just war theorists."
